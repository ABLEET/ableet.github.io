        <h1>How to install Clang 9 on Linux</h1>
        <p> If you need to get Clang 9 working on Linux, you’ll be happy to know that most Linux releases, even Linux 21.04, the latest release, have it in its software repository. To get going with Clang 9, start by opening up a terminal window. </p>
        <p>To open up a terminal window on the Linux desktop, press Ctrl + Alt + T on the keyboard. Once it is open, use the apt install command below to install the Clang 9 package. Be sure to use the –install-suggests command-line switch, as it will tell Linux to grab everything you need to use Clang 9.</p>
        <span>sudo apt install clang-9 --install-suggests</span>
        <p>Following entering this command in a terminal window, Ubuntu will prompt you to enter a password. Do so. When you do, it will collect all suggested packages for you to install on your PC.</p>
        <p>After Ubuntu collects all the packages for you to install, you’ll be prompted to press the Y key on the keyboard. Press the Y key on the keyboard to confirm that you wish to proceed with the installation.</p>
        <p>Upon pressing Y, Ubuntu will install Clang 9 on your system. When done, close the terminal window, or begin using Clang 9 in the command line.</p>
